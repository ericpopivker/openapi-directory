Directory of clean Open API yaml specs

When implement [PandaFlow App](https://www.pandaflow.io), we needed to integrate with many APIs. The common standard for API schemas 
is [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/). Surprisingly not many companies provide OpenAPI spec and even if they do, there
are many problems.

PandaFlow App provides seemless intergration to all the APIs, so if you are short on time, go ahead and use that.
But if you are DYI type of guy, you can just download one our our cleaned up OpenAPI spec files and be on your way to enlightment<sup>*</sup>.


# List of OpenAPI Specs
